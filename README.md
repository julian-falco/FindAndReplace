# FindAndReplace
This program is intended for use with the RECONSTRUCT software developed by the Harris Lab.

Given a set of section files, this program will find a certain set of characters and replace them with whatever is requested by the user.
For example, all objects with "d013" can be renamed so that they contain "d001" instead.
